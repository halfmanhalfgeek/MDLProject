	<AssumptionBody>Emax model fixed to 100&#37; is a more physiological description of the data compared to a linear model.</AssumptionBody>
	<Justification>Emax model is not better than linear model; however, for this drug class, Emax of 100%&#37; is more realistic.</Justification>

Comparison of simulated metrics of interest between the two competing models.

	<TestOutcome>To achieve a 90&#37; response (assumed to be clinically meaningful) requires a twofold higher dose using the Emax model compared to the linear model.</TestOutcome>
